Task 1:
  - Split the images into testing/validation/training
  - Maybe 900 into testing, 100 into validation and 100 into training
  - Write a Python script to separate them (use a seed to initialize the random generator)

  - Assigned: Narendro

Task 2:
  - Use the datagenerators (ImageDataGenerator)
  - Good opportunity to do data augmentation (rescaling, zooming, rotating, etc.) and/or some adversarial examples
  - Can do in parallel with task 1 (just assume the directory structure)

  - Assigned: Mark

Task 3:
  - Build and train the network
  - Try and search for some cross-val and see what hyperparameters to test
  
  - Assigned: Michele and Bianca

Task 4:
  - Visualizing the result
  - Loss vs epochs and validation vs epochs would be obv nice
  - We have images => CNN => feature maps, filters/kernels
